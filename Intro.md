Welcome to **Pinternship** – a comprehensive **Full-Stack Development Internship Program** conducted under the expert guidance of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** at **IIT Ropar's VLED Lab**.

This internship is designed for learners who are passionate about mastering modern web development technologies and building real-world applications.

---

## What You'll Learn

This program follows a structured, progressive learning pathway covering the complete **MERN stack** and beyond:

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for building scalable applications
- **React** - Modern frontend development with component-based architecture
- **Express.js** - Backend API development and server-side logic
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database design and management

### Key Concepts
- Advanced TypeScript patterns and type systems
- State management
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Database operations and aggregation frameworks
- Dependency injection and middleware
- Performance optimization and code splitting
- Testing and debugging strategies

---

## Program Structure

The internship program consists of **three required components** that all participants must complete:

### 1. Core Learning: ViBe Training (Required)
Complete all modules on the **ViBe platform** covering TypeScript, React, Express.js, and MongoDB. This foundational training provides the core knowledge needed for full-stack development.

### 2. Advanced Learning: Case Studies (Required)
Work through hands-on case studies that apply the concepts learned from ViBe training. These practical exercises deepen your understanding through real-world scenarios and implementation patterns.

### 3. Practical Learning: Projects (Required)
Build comprehensive projects that demonstrate your mastery of the MERN stack. This final component allows you to create portfolio-worthy applications under guidance from the VLED Lab team.

### Opportunities for Top Performers
Participants who successfully complete all three components may receive:
- **Recommendations** from VLED lab teaching team
- **Internship opportunities** with VLED Lab for further practical experience
